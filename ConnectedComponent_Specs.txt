Project 3: You are to implement the  4-connected component algorithm 
           (NOT 8-connected!!!)

I. Input: A binary image.
	     C++ in argv[1] 
	     Java in argv[0] 
II. Outputs: 

   (a) outFile1:   in argv[2] in C++ and Java argv[1] Java for:
  
	 1) Pretty print the result of the Pass-1 and the EQAry with proper captions
	 2) Pretty print the result of the Pass-2 and the EQAry with proper captions
	 3) print EQAry after manage the EQAry 
	 4) Pretty print the result of the Pass-3 and the EQAry with proper caption

   (b) outFile2:   in argv[3] in C++ and Java in argv[2] for:
 
	 5) create an image file from the result of Pass-3 with header for
		future processing.

   (c) outFile3: in argv[4] in C++ and argv[3] in Java for:
	 (6) Output the connected component property using the format given below
 				// print the header of the CC image, follows by the 
				// The numbers of the c.c. follows by the properties of 
				// each c.c. components.

III. Data structure:
*******************************
	- numRows (int)
	- numCols (int)
	- minVal (int)
	- maxVal (int)
	- newMin (int)
	- newMax (int)
 
	- newLabel (int) // initallize to 0

	- zeroFramedAry (int **) a 2D array, need to dynamically allocate at run time
			of size numRows + 2 by numCols + 2.

	- NeighborAry[4](int) // during the first pass, p(i,j) looks at upper and left neighbors, and 
					// during the second pass, p(i,j) looks at bottom  and right neighbors and itself 
	
	- EQAry (int *) // a 1-D array, need to dynamically allocate at run time
				// of size ( numRows * numCols) / 2 
				// and initallize to EQAry[i] = i. 

	- Property (1D struct) //a table that store the properties of connected components.
				// need to dynamicaly allocate at run time.
				// the size is the number of components + 1
				// struct includes
					- label
					- numbpixels
					- boundingBox : (minRow, minCol, maxRow, maxCol)
			       
    - methods:
	- constructor(s) // need to dynamically allocate all arrays; 
				and assign values to numRows,..., etc.

	- zeroFrame // zero framing the image as taught in class
	- loadImage // read from input file and load zeroFramedAry begin at (1,1)
	- loadNeighbors // load the respective neighbors of given pixel(i,j)

	- ConnectCC_Pass1  
	- ConnectCC_Pass2
	- ConnectCC_Pass3  // In the pass3, you will use the EQAry to relable the components 
					// as well as compute the property of each c.c.
	- updateEQAry
	- manageEQAry	  // manage the EQAry so to findout true number of connected components..
	- printCCProperty // print the header of the CC image, follows by the 
				  // true numbers of the c.c. follows by the properties of 
				  // each c.c. components: For example

				45 40 0 8  // CC image header
				8   // there are a total of 8 CC
				1   // CC label #1
				87	// 87 pixels in CC label #1
				4  9  // upper left most pixel of the bounding box of CC #1
				35  39  // lower right most pixel of the bounding box
				:
				:

			
	- prettyPrint

III. Algorithms 
*******************************
  
step 0: read the image header
	   dynamically allocate zeroFramedAry and all other arrays

step 1: load the input image onto zeroFramedAry


step 2: - ConnectCC_Pass1 // as taught in class
	   - prettyprint the result of pass1// with proper caption
	   - print EQAry	// with index up to newLable with proper caption

step 3: - ConnectCC_Pass2 // as taught in class
	   - prettyprint the result of pass2// with caption
	   - print EQAry // with index up to newLable with caption

step 4:  - manageEQAry // see algorithm below. 
 	   - print EQAry // with index up to newLable with caption

step 5: - ConnectCC_Pass3  // In the pass3, you will use the EQAry to relabel the components;
					// keep track the newMin newMax 
					// as well as compute the property of each c.c.
					// and store the c. c.  properties 
					

	   - prettyprint the result of pass3 of the connected c.c.  // with caption
	   - Output the result of pass3 to outFile2 with updated image header
         - print the propertis of the connected c.c. // with proper caption

***********************************
Algoritm for manageEQAry
***********************************
step 1: trueLabel <-- 0
step 2: index <-- 1
step 3: if EQAry[index] == index
           trueLabel++
		EQAry[index] <-- trueLabel
	   else
		EQAry[index] <-- EQAry[EQAry[index]] 

step 4: repeat step 3 until index > newLabel
